HTTP GET is used to request data from a specified resource. It appends parameters to the URL as query strings, making it visible in the address bar. Use GET for safe, idempotent actions like fetching data or performing searches.

HTTP POST is used to submit data to be processed (e.g., sending data to be stored). Parameters are sent in the body of the request and do not appear in the URL. Use POST for operations that modify server state or create new resources.
