> The main difference between var and let in JavaScript is how they handle scope.

> Var declares a variable with function scope,

> while let declares a variable with block scope.

> This affects how long the variable is accessible.

> For example, if you use var inside a loop, the variable will be accessible after the loop finishes.

> If you use let, the variable will only be accessible within the loop.

> This can help prevent bugs and improve code readability.
