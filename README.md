**❓ Q. What is the purpose of the `let` keyword in JavaScript, and how does it differ from `var`?**

The `let` keyword in JavaScript declares a block-scoped local variable. It differs from `var` in that variables declared with `let` have limited scope to the block (e.g., statement or control flow structure) in which they are defined, whereas `var` is function-scoped. This means that `let` does not create global variables and can be more predictable when used within loops and conditions.
