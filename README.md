Both `display: flex` and `display: grid` can be used to create layouts, but `display: flex` is used for linear layouts and `display: grid` is used for two-dimensional layouts. `display: flex` is also more flexible when it comes to aligning items, whereas `display: grid` provides more control over the layout of items within the grid.
