A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) consists of several parts:

- **Scheme**: Indicates the protocol used, e.g., `http` or `https`.
- **Host**: The domain name or IP address of the server, e.g., `www.example.com`.
- **Path**: Specifies the resource path on the server, e.g., `/api/v1/data`.
- **Query Parameters**: Additional information passed to the server in a query string format, e.g., `?page=2&sort=desc`.
- **Fragment Identifier**: Not part of the URL sent to the server but used by browsers for client-side navigation.
