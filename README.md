The `display` property is used to control the type of box model used by an element, and can also be used to control the display of an element's children. It can have values like `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, etc. The `display` property can also be used to create a flexible box layout model, which is a powerful tool for building responsive and flexible web layouts.
