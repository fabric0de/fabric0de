> In CSS, 'float' is used to remove an element from the normal document flow

> It allows elements to float next to each other or to other elements.

> On the other hand, 'sticky' is used to make an element stick to a specific position within its parent element.

> It keeps the element in the same position on the page even when the user scrolls.

> Sticky positioning is useful for creating scrolling pages or for maintaining layout stability.

> In summary, 'float' is about positioning an element relative to other elements,

> while 'sticky' is about positioning an element relative to its parent element.
