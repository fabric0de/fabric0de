> The this keyword in JavaScript refers to the context in which a function is called.

> It can be the global object, a local object, or an object passed as an argument to a function.

> It can also be set using the bind(), call(), or apply() methods.

> In arrow functions, the this keyword does not refer to the global object.

> In inheritance, the this keyword refers to the prototype chain.
