> `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object value

> `undefined` is also a primitive value but indicates that a variable has been declared but has no assigned value

> Both are primitive values but serve different purposes in the language

> They can be assigned to a variable using the `null` and `undefined` keywords respectively

> They are not the same and should not be confused with each other
