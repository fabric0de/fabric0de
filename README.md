The `let` keyword in JavaScript is used to declare variables with block scope. It was introduced as part of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) to address some limitations of `var`. When you use `let`, the variable is only accessible within its block, function, or loop, whereas `var` declares a variable globally or locally to an entire function, regardless of blocks.
