> The HTTP PUT method is used to update existing resources on a server.

> It replaces the entire resource with the new version.

> It is similar to the POST method but with the difference that the client must provide the entire resource in the request body.

> Also, the server must support the "If-Match" header to prevent overwriting of unchanged resources.
