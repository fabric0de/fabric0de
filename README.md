> In synchronous code, a program executes one line at a time,

> and waits for the result before moving to the next line.

> In asynchronous code, a program executes multiple lines simultaneously,

> and uses callbacks or promises to handle the result.

> This makes asynchronous code more efficient for I/O-bound tasks.

> However, it requires more error handling and synchronization logic.
