**❓ Q. What is the difference between `let` and `const` in JavaScript?**

Both `let` and `const` are used to declare variables, but with key differences. `let` allows variable reassignment within its scope, whereas `const` does not (it declares a block-scoped, read-only reference to a value), meaning that if you try to reassign the constant, it will throw an error. For example: ```js
let x = 10; // Can be reassigned
x = 20;

const y = 10; // Cannot be reassigned
// y = 20; // This line would cause a TypeError
```
