> Null is a value that represents the absence of any object value.

> Undefined is a variable that has never been declared or initialized.

> In other words, null is a value, while undefined is a variable.

> Null is not always equal to undefined, except in the case where a variable is explicitly set to null.

> Null is not undefined, and undefined is not null.

> This distinction is important to understand when working with variables in JavaScript.
