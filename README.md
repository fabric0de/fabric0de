> null is a value that represents the absence of any object value.

> undefined is a value that represents an uninitialized variable.

> In other words, null is a value, while undefined is a variable.

> Examples of null include:

> const person = null;

> console.log(person);

> On the other hand, undefined is typically used for variables that have not been assigned a value.

> const name = ;

> console.log(name);
