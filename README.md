> The `this` keyword refers to the current execution context of a function.

> It can also refer to the object that a function is called on.

> In constructors, `this` binds to the newly created object.

> The value of `this` can be overridden by the `bind()` method.

> It can also be used to access the context of a function within an arrow function.

> In some cases, `this` can be undefined if used without a context.

> It can also be used to access properties of the global object.

> It can also be used as a context object for the function when called as a function.
