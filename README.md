> A class is a template for creating objects,

> which have properties and methods.

> A function is a block of code that can be reused,

> to perform a specific task, without creating an object.

> Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions,

> and can be used as event handlers.

> Functions cannot be instantiated like classes can.

> They are also not tied to a specific object.

> They can be shared across the application.

> They have their own scope and can be reused.

> Functions can also be overridden in inheritance.

> Functions are also useful for recursion and higher-order functions.

> Functions can be anonymous.

> They can be defined inside other functions.

> They can also be defined outside of classes.

> Functions are first-class citizens in many programming languages.

> They can be stored in data structures like arrays and maps.

> They can be passed as arguments to other functions.

> They can be returned as values from functions.
