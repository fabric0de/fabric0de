> The require function is used to import modules in Node.js.

> It allows you to load modules and use their functions and variables.

> This is necessary because Node.js is an interpreted language and does not have a pre-compiled version of every module.

> This makes it easy to extend the functionality of your application by adding new modules as needed.

> It also helps to avoid polluting the global namespace.

> It is the primary way to import modules in Node.js.
