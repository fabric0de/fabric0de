Both `document.getElementById()` and `querySelector` are methods used to select elements from the DOM, but they differ in their usage. `getElementById` returns a single element by its unique ID, while `querySelector` can be used to select a single element based on any valid CSS selector. It supports more complex queries and is generally considered more flexible and powerful for selecting elements.
