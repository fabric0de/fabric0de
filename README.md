> The `await` keyword is used with promises to pause the execution of an asynchronous function until the promise is resolved or rejected.

> It allows developers to write asynchronous code that is easier to read and maintain.

> It can also be used with async/await syntax.

> Awaiting a promise means waiting for the promise to resolve before continuing execution of the function.

> This can help prevent race conditions and improve performance.
