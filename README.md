> null is a value that represents the absence of any object value.

> undefined is a value that represents an uninitialized variable.

> In other words, null is a specific value,

> while undefined is a state.

> A variable is undefined until it is assigned a value.

> Null is always a value.

> It is worth noting that both can be set to the same value.
