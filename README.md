> The `async` keyword in JavaScript

> allows a function to be paused and resumed at specific points,

> allowing other code to run in the meantime.

> This is useful for handling long-running operations or I/O operations.

> It also enables the use of `await` to pause the function's execution until a promise is resolved.

> This makes it easier to write asynchronous code that is easier to read and maintain.
