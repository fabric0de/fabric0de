> > The `process.stdin` object represents the standard input stream, allowing you to read input from the user or a file. The `process.stdout` object represents the standard output stream, allowing you to send output to the console or a file. You can use these objects to read input and send output in a Node.js program. You can use the `readline` module to read input from stdin and the `writeFileSync` method to send output to stdout. The `process.stdin` object also allows you to read data from a file using the `readFileSync` method. You can also use the `process.stdout.write()` method to send output to the console.
