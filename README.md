> The `!important` keyword can only be used once per property declaration. Using `!important !important` is unnecessary and can lead to unexpected results. In general, it's recommended to use `!important` sparingly and only when necessary. Using multiple `!important` flags can make the code harder to read and understand. It's also worth noting that some browsers may interpret different numbers of `!important` flags differently.
