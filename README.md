> The require function is used to import modules in Node.js.

> It allows the execution of JavaScript files from a specific directory or from the global node_modules directory.

> It is the main function for requiring modules in Node.js.

> It returns the required module.

> Common use cases include importing built-in modules, such as fs and path.

> Also, it can be used to import custom modules written in JavaScript.

> Requiring a module does not execute the code in the module.

> Instead, the module is cached and reused if it has already been required.
