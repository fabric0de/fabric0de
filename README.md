> let is block-scoped,

> var is function-scoped.

> This means that let variables are redeclared if they have the same name in an inner scope,

> while var variables can be accessed from any outer scope.

> This change was introduced in ECMAScript 2015.

> It helps to prevent variables from being reused with different values in different parts of the code.

> It makes the code more predictable and easier to maintain.

> It also helps to avoid unexpected behavior in older browsers.

> Don't use var if you're writing new code for modern browsers.

> Use let instead.
