> The HTTP method "PUT" is used to update existing resources on a server.

> It is similar to "POST", but it only updates the specified resource.

> Unlike "POST", "PUT" requires the client to provide the entire resource in the request body.

> This ensures that the server knows exactly which parts of the resource need to be updated.
