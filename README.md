> let is block-scoped, while var is function-scoped.

> This means that let variables are recreated on each declaration,

> while var variables are shared across the entire function.

> For example:

> var x = 10;

> let y = 10;

> console.log(y);

> let y = 20;

> console.log(y);

> x;

> console.log(x);
