> Null and undefined are both used to represent the absence of any object value.

> However, null is a primitive value, whereas undefined is a variable that has not been declared or assigned a value.

> Null is often used to represent a deliberate absence of a value, whereas undefined is used to indicate an uninitialized variable.

> In other words, if you try to access a property of null, JavaScript will throw an error.

> But if you try to access a property of undefined, it will return undefined.
