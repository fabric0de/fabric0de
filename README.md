> The require function is used to import modules in Node.js.

> These modules contain functions and variables that can be used in your application.

> It is similar to importing modules in other languages like Python or Ruby.

> It allows you to use functions and variables from a module without having to copy and paste them yourself.

> This makes your code more modular and easier to maintain.
