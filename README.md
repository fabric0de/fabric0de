> The 'this' keyword refers to the current object in a given context.

> It can also refer to the global object if no context is specified.

> In ES6, 'this' can be explicitly bound using arrow functions.

> However, 'this' can also have unexpected behavior in certain situations.

> In constructors, 'this' refers to the new object being created.

> It is often used in callbacks and event listeners to refer to the original context.
