> The `async` keyword is used to define a function that returns a promise.

> It allows the function to run asynchronously, meaning it doesn't block the execution of other code.

> This is useful for handling multiple tasks concurrently.

> It also helps with error handling and promises.

> For example:

> async function example() {

> console.log('Hello');

> await new Promise((resolve) => resolve('World'));

> console.log('Done');

> }

> example();
